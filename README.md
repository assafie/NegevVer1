# SEAD - NegevVer1
The purpose of the Spatially Explicit Agricultural Dynamics (SEAD) Negev model is to understand agricultural land-use change dynamics using RS techniques and spatially explicit high-resolution modeling of the rules that govern change. In particular, the expansion of agricultural land in frontier rural areas is of special interest. 
This model was implemented using the Repast  Simphony (2.1) Simulation Toolkit.
