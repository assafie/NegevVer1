# SEAD - NegevVer1
# NegevVer1:
The purpose of the Spatially Explicit Agricultural Dynamics (SEAD) Negev model is to understand agricultural land-use change dynamics using RS techniques and spatially explicit high-resolution modeling of the rules that govern change. In particular, the expansion of agricultural land in frontier rural areas is of special interest. 
This model was implemented using the Repast  Simphony (2.1) Simulation Toolkit.

# NegevVer3:
This version of the SEAD model examines how an increase in connectedness to irrigation infrastructure, and a decrease in precipitation, might affect wheat yields, irrigated vegetables cultivated areas, and grazing carrying capacity.  Plot crop type probabilities were created based on crop types that were cultivated in the plot during the previous two and three years (there are two versions of this implementation).
