The purpose of the model is to understand agricultural land-use change dynamics using RS techniques and spatially explicit high-resolution modeling of the rules that govern change. In particular, the expansion of agricultural land in frontier rural areas is of special interest. 
This model was implemented using the Repast Simulation Simphony Toolkit.
