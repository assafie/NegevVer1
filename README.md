# SEAD - NegevVer1
# NegevVer1:
The purpose of the Spatially Explicit Agricultural Dynamics (SEAD) Negev model is to understand agricultural land-use change dynamics using RS techniques and spatially explicit high-resolution modeling of the rules that govern change. In particular, the expansion of agricultural land in frontier rural areas is of special interest. This model was implemented using the Repast  Simphony (2.1) Simulation Toolkit.

# NegevVer3:
This version of the SEAD model examines how an increase in connectedness to irrigation infrastructure, and a decrease in precipitation, might affect wheat yields, irrigated vegetables cultivated areas, and grazing carrying capacity.  Plot crop type probabilities were created based on crop types that were cultivated in the plot during the previous two and three years (there are two versions of this implementation).

# MaliVer1:
The Mali model simulates rain-fed traditional low-tech agriculture. Shifting cultivation is a commonplace agricultural practice in West Africa, since farmers can't afford buying fertilization, they leave their plots fallow until the soil regains its organic matter. A cycle of 10-12 years of cultivation and 10-15 years of rest (fallow) for a parcel is typical. High population growth rates increases the pressure on food production, pushing farmers to seek for other virgin lands for cultivation, and overexploitation of agricultural lands, resulting in a slow and inevitable decrease in Soil Organic Matter (SOM), thus leading to existing agricultural lands abandonment and agricultural collapse. This version of the SEAD model simulates family agricultural land-use around Kita, Mali, establishing the connection between agricultural practice and soil degradation. Using space-borne data of the Kita area during 1975-2003, an analysis of agricultural land-use dynamics for these years was conducted and rules for agricultural practice and exapnsion into virgin open land were created.
